# TimeoutResurgence_v2
Updated program used in Houchins et al. (2022; http://dx.doi.org.liblink.uncw.edu/10.1007/s40732-020-00455-6). Includes a multielement design embedded in a 3-phase resurgence procedure. In the second phase, the target response is punished by a time out from positive reinforcement in one component but not the other.
